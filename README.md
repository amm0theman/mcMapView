# mcMapView
Small text based minecraft map surveyor
Can view slices of 16x16 with block ID's shown
Sample map should be included, run in Debug configuration for guaranteed success
can go north east south west, up and down
can't manually open or save those buttons do nothing (ran out of time)
map is boring so i don't think you will get any slice with any variance, don't have time to find a good map
but the main functionality works and was tricky so haha chalk it up as a W boys
